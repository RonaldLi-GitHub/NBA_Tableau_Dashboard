# NBA Data Visualization

**Summary**
---
In This project I attempt to retrieve all NBA-related data such as players, teams, games, game statistics since the 1979 season. Data is collected from the free API at https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction. The API is constantly updated with current game data up to and including the current 2021 season. For this project, I will focus on seasons 1979 through 2019. I use Python to extract data from the API, clean the data and insert the data into a PostgreSQL database. Once all data is stored in the PostgreSQL database, I perform various queries from the database and import the results to Tableau Public to create an interactive dashboard.
